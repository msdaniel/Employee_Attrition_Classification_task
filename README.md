# Employee Attrition Prediction

## 1. Introduction

Employee attrition, the departure of employees from an organization either voluntarily or involuntarily, is a critical aspect of workforce management. This project aims to address the challenge of predicting employee attrition by treating it as a classification machine learning problem. By leveraging Logistic Regression and Neural Network models, we seek to identify whether an employee is likely to attrite.

### 1.1 Motivation

Understanding and predicting employee attrition is vital for organizations to proactively manage their workforce, retain valuable talent, and make informed decisions about human resources.

### 1.2 Methodology

The analysis in this report focuses on the application of Logistic Regression and Neural Networks as machine learning classification algorithms. We utilize the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset][(link_to_dataset_on_data.world)](https://data.world/aaizemberg/hr-employee-attrition/workspace/file?filename=WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.tsv.txt) to explore the predictive capabilities of these models.

## 2. Datasets

The project utilizes the publicly available [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset] https://data.world/aaizemberg/hr-employee-attrition/workspace/file?filename=WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.tsv.txt, containing 1470 records of employees and 35 features (columns). The dataset is clean, with no missing values or duplicated employee records.


## 3. Implementation

The project involves the implementation of Logistic Regression and Neural Network models for predicting employee attrition. Detailed explanations of the model architectures, training processes, and evaluation metrics can be found in the corresponding code file.

### 3.1 Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
